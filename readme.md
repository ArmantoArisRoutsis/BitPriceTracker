#BITCOIN PRICE TRACKER

##This is a little project that I made in order to better understand the Next.js framework. The application utilizes the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index API to track real-time changes of Bitcoin and display it in 3 different currencies(USD/GBP/EUR).

##The reason that this little application came to fruition was mentioned above as well, to get a stronger grasp of the Next.js framework as well as solidify my React.js knowledge even more.

##Built with
*React.js
*Next.js

##API used
*CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index API (https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json)

##Installation Process
Installation should be fairly simple. Running "npm install" should be more than enough. In case that any issues occur feel free to contact me.
